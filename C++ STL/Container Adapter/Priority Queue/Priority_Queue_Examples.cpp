/*
    Priority queue is generally backed by a heap.
    Meanwhile, Set/MultiSet is generally backed by a binary tree.

    Binary Trees sort sideways, while heaps sort upwards.
    So, while we can know the relationship of L,P,R in a binary tree.
    But, we could not know the realtionship of L,R in a heap.

    The main difference is that priority queue only gives access to one element.
    Meanwhile, Sets allow full access to every element.
